# Hexagonal Refactoring
This repository was created to refactor a project to use hexagonal architecture and clean code concepts.  
The inital project was based on an MBA Java project in this [link](https://github.com/devfullcycle/MBA-hexagonal-architecture), and converted to a C# language version.  
Change to the git branch `refactoring` to see each step of the refactoring process.
